MacPherson|Risk assessment/management and chemistry education|I am chemistry the laboratory coordinator and radiation safety officer at York College of Pennsylvania.  My research interests include environmental risk assessment and risk management, chemical demonstration safety, laboratory safety in secondary education, and developing technique guides to aid research students.|style/MacPherson.jpg|2"
"Dr.Steel|chemistryisfun|wsteel@ycp.edu|Dr. William H. Steel|Chemistry of interfaces and chemical education|My research has primarily focused on topics related to solvation of chemicals at or near interfaces.  I have studied air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces, and do so with a variety of techniques, including surface tensiometry,  UV-vis spectroscopy, and time-correlated single photon counting spectroscopy (TCSPCS, done with a  collaborator at Montana State University).  Additionally, I have begun explorations of solute partitioning into phospholipid membranes via differential scanning calorimetry and TCSPCS.  I also strive to help students learn better in the laboratory by designing and developing new procedures and experiments for our General Chemistry laboratory curriculum.|style/Steel.jpg|2"
"Dr.Halligan|ochemismylife|khalliga@ycp.edu|Dr. Kathleen M. Halligan|Organic Synthesis, Biosynthetic Pathways, Green Chemistry|The focus of my research includes synthesis of biologically relevant molecules, isolation of natural products and investigation of biosynthetic pathways. I also enjoy infusing principles of green chemistry and sustainability into the design of these projects.|style/Halligan.jpg|2"
"Dr.Howard|ochemisgreat|khoward2@ycp.edu|Dr. Kyle T. Howard|Organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry|In my studies I have established a new methodology for the formation of ethers under neutral thermal conditions. Preparation of p-methoxybenzyl and diphenyl methyl ethers was accomplished utilizing the respective trichloroacetimidate without an acid or base catalyst. Additionally, similar reaction conditions were defined for the synthesis of thioethers and esters.  My doctoral studies also focused on the design, synthesis, and characterization of aminosteroid inhibitors for the inositol phosphatase SHIP1. Inhibition of SHIP1 has been shown to facilitate engraftment of MHC-I mismatched bone marrow grafts, increase the number of adult stem cells in vivo, facilitate the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and cause apoptosis in some blood cancer cell lines. I have developed a series of steroid-based compounds that show biological activity as SHIP1 inhibitors.|style/Howard.jpg|2"
"Dr.Fautch|ochemguru|jfautch@ycp.edu|Dr. Jessica M. Fautch|Bioinorganic chemistry: the role of metals in cancer prevention and treatment; Chemical Education: the inclusive support of students in STEM majors|My training in inorganic chemistry in chemopreventative vanadium and selenium complexes led to a post-doctoral study in oncology where I investigated genetic implications for breast cancer using a rat model. These very different (but connected) experiences have resulted in an interdisciplinary approach to my research at York College: using yeast as a model organism for studying copper-induced oxidative DNA damage. Additionally, as I became more involved with my students at YCP, I gained experience and interest in learning how to best support my students in their learning of chemistry. I regularly adopt new technologies in the classroom and study how these pedagogical approaches can support my students. Finally, I am excited to direct a new residential learning community, the STEM Scholars, in an effort to support cohorts of students as they navigate STEM majors and embark upon research.|style/Fautch.jpg|2"
