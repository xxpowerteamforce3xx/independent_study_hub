My research interests include environmental risk assessment and risk management, chemical demonstration safety, laboratory safety in secondary education, and developing technique guides to aid research students.|style/MacPherson.jpg|2"
Dr.Steel|chemistryisfun|wsteel@ycp.edu|Dr. William Steel|Chemistry of interfaces and chemical education|My research has primarily focused on topics related to solvation of chemicals at or near interfaces.  I have studied air-liquid and liquid-liquid interfaces, and do so with a variety of techniques, including surface tensiometry,  UV-vis spectroscopy, and time-correlated single photon counting spectroscopy (TCSPCS, done with a  collaborator at Montana State University).  Additionally, I have begun explorations of solute partitioning into phospholipid membranes via differential scanning calorimetry and TCSPCS.  I also strive to help students learn better in the laboratory by designing and developing new procedures and experiments for our General Chemistry laboratory curriculum.|style/Steel.jpg|2"
Dr.Howard|ochemisgreat|khoward2@ycp.edu|Dr. Kyle Howard|Organic synthesis and medicinal chemistry|In my studies I have established a new methodology for the formation of ethers under neutral thermal conditions. Preparation of p-methoxybenzyl and diphenyl methyl ethers was accomplished utilizing the respective trichloroacetimidate without an acid or base catalyst. Additionally, similar reaction conditions were defined for the synthesis of thioethers and esters.  My doctoral studies also focused on the design, synthesis, and characterization of aminosteroid inhibitors for the inositol phosphatase SHIP1. Inhibition of SHIP1 has been shown to facilitate engraftment of MHC-I mismatched bone marrow grafts, increase the number of adult stem cells in vivo, facilitate the mobilization of hematopoietic stem cells and cause apoptosis in some blood cancer cell lines. I have developed a series of steroid-based compounds that show biological activity as SHIP1 inhibitors.|style/Howard.jpg|2"
